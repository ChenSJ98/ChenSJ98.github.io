  abstract = {We present TacoBot, a task-oriented dialogue system built for the inaugural Alexa Prize TaskBot Challenge, which assists users in completing multi-step cooking and home improvement tasks. TacoBot is designed with a user-centered principle and aspires to deliver a collaborative and accessible dialogue experience. Towards that end, it is equipped with accurate language understanding, flexible dialogue management, and engaging response generation. Furthermore, TacoBot is backed by a strong search engine and an automated end-to-end test suite. In bootstrapping the development of TacoBot, we explore a series of data augmentation strategies to train advanced neural language processing models and continuously improve the dialogue experience with collected real conversations. At the end of the semifinals, TacoBot achieved an average rating of 3.55/5.0.},

  abstract = {Deep learning approaches have achieved great success in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, deep neural models often suffer from overfitting and data scarcity problems that are pervasive in NLP tasks. In recent years, Multi-Task Learning (MTL), which can leverage useful information of related tasks to achieve simultaneous performance improvement on multiple related tasks, has been used to handle these problems. In this paper, we give an overview of the use of MTL in NLP tasks. We first review MTL architectures used in NLP tasks and categorize them into four classes, including the parallel architecture, hierarchical architecture, modular architecture, and generative adversarial architecture. Then we present optimization techniques on loss construction, data sampling, and task scheduling to properly train a multi-task model. After presenting applications of MTL in a variety of NLP tasks, we introduce some benchmark datasets. Finally, we make a conclusion and discuss several possible research directions in this field.},

  abstract = {The world is currently facing significant challenges in feeding a growing population with declining resources. Urban agriculture and vertical farming have the potential to provide a revolutionary new food supply and distribution network capable of feeding large populations in the 21st Century; as well as increase quality and reduce negative impacts on the natural environment. The concept has attracted a lot of attention from governments and business throughout the world recently. This paper describes a framework for applying technologies from Agent Based Models, Simulation and Computational Intelligence to analyze, optimize and manage ``ecosystems'' for urban agriculture and vertical farming for food production from the perspective of stakeholders including consumers, producers, and policy makers.},

This paper contributes a modelling framework for urban agriculture, and an implementation in a scenario based on the fast growing mega city of Shenzhen located near Hong Kong in southern China. We also review related work and provide a gap analysis between requirements for modelling modern urban agricultural systems versus related work that looks at agricultural supply chains, production, and land use. The proposed framework will facilitate developing a novel decision support system to coordinate decentralized urban agricultural production units in order to realize, at scale, numerous benefits from co-locating production and consumption in the urban environment.},
