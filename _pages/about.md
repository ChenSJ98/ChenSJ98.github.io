# About me
Hi, I'm Shijie Chen (陈士杰), a second-year Ph.D. student at The [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) (OSU) co-advised by [Prof. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io) and [Prof. Huan Sun](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~sun.397/). Before joining OSU, I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn) (SUSTech) in Shenzhen, China. Here is my [CV](../assets/pdf/resume.pdf).

My research interest lies in natural language processing (NLP) with an emphasis on semantic parsing and task-oriented dialogue systems. I'm generally interested in understanding language semantics and building AI systems that are more interpretable and trustworthy.
